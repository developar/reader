Everyone has a device, sometimes multiple devices. It’s been a long time since we have had this rate of change—it probably hasn’t happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago.  To make the most of these opportunities, we need to focus—otherwise we spread ourselves too thin and lack impact.  So today we’re announcing some more closures, bringing the total to 70 features or services closed since our <a href=\\\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html\\\">spring cleaning began</a> in 2011:<br>\\n<br>\\n<ul>\\n<li><b>Apps Script </b>will be deprecating the <b>GUI Builder</b> and <b>five UiApp widgets</b> in order to focus efforts on <a href=\\\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/06/big-updates-for-apps-script.html\\\">Html Service</a>. The rest of the Ui Service will not be affected. The GUI Builder will continue to be available until September 16, 2013. For more information see <a href=\\\"http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/03/retiring-a-few-apps-script-components.html\\\">our post</a> on the Google Apps Developer Blog.</li>\\n<li><b><a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/caldav\\\">CalDAV API</a> </b>will become available for whitelisted developers, and will be shut down for other developers on September 16, 2013. Most developers’ use cases are handled well by <a href=\\\"https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/\\\">Google Calendar API</a>, which we recommend using instead. If you’re a developer and the Calendar API won’t work for you, please fill out <a href=\\\"https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/19gOLSlkTzHi-zub3BkMv7Ot0JMLPj4YSxJUBseGAMSg/viewform\\\">this form</a> to tell us about your use case and request access to whitelisted-only CalDAV API.</li>\\n<li><b>Google Building Maker</b> helped people to make three-dimensional building models for Google Earth and Maps. It will be retired on June 1, but users are still able to access and export their models from the 3D Warehouse.

Existing users will no longer be able to use Cloud Connect as of April 30.</li>\\n<li>We launched <b>Google Reader</b> in 2005 in an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites. While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader. Users and developers interested in RSS alternatives can export their data, including their subscriptions, with <a href=\\\"http://www.dataliberation.org/google/reader\\\">Google Takeout</a> over the course of the next four months.</li>\\n<li>Beginning next week, we're ending support for the <b>Google Voice App for Blackberry</b>. For Blackberry users who want to continue using Google Voice, we recommend they use our <a href=\\\"https://www.google.com/voice/m?uipref=1\\\">HTML5 app</a>, which is more secure and easier for us to keep up to date.  Our HTML5 site is compatible with users with Blackberry version 6 and newer.</li>\\n<li>We’re deprecating our <b>Search API for Shopping</b>, which has enabled developers to create shopping apps based on Google’s Product Search data.

These methods deliver bonuses in ways you may not have recognized as getting paid to save. (See also: <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/5-best-online-savings-accounts\\\">The 5 Best Online Savings Accounts</a>)</p>\\n<h3>1. Claim the Saver's Credit</h3>\\n<p>This money comes from the federal government via the IRS. Through the <a href=\\\"http://www.irs.gov/publications/p590/ch05.html\\\">Retirement Savings Contributions Credit</a> (aka Saver's Credit), you can get up to $1,000 (or $2,000 if married filing jointly) if you contribute to a <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/choosing-a-retirement-account-whats-available-and-what-s-best-for-you\\\">qualified retirement account</a> and meet certain requirements, which most notably include income limits.</p>\\n<p>You can't make more than $28,750 in modified adjusted gross income ($43,125 if head of household or $57,500 if married filing jointly) to be eligible. At those income levels, you may not have a lot of extra cash to sock away for retirement, but if you do save, you'll get a nice bonus. Use <a href=\\\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf\\\">Form 8880</a> to calculate and claim your credit.</p>\\n<h3>2. Win Prizes and Rewards for Saving Money</h3>\\n<p>You can earn rewards and may be able to win prizes by tracking your savings with a couple of online services.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://www.saveup.com/\\\">SaveUp</a> helps you to monitor savings and debt payoff, and gives you the opportunity to play for prizes that range from a $100 gift card to a $2 million jackpot. The site also dispenses rewards in the form of promotional offers.<br>\\n     </li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.smartypig.com/\\\">SmartyPig</a> gives you a place to save money for specific purposes such as a summer trip to the beach or new flooring for your house. When you have accumulated the dollars, you can redeem your savings by 1) transferring money to your checking account, 2) loading money to a prepaid debit card, or 3) receiving a gift card from certain retailers. While option #1 doesn't give you extra cash, you'll get 1% more if you take your savings on the debit card and a bonus of up to 11% if you choose a gift card.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>3. Earn Bonuses for Setting Aside Money in Savings Accounts</h3>\\n<p>Many banks and credit unions have cash incentives for customers who commit to saving. For example, BBVA Compass matches a percentage of transfers from a checking account to a savings account; you can earn up to $250 per year through the <a href=\\\"http://www.bbvacompass.com/buildmysavings/\\\">Build My Savings program</a>. Bank of America also contributes up to $250 through its <a href=\\\"http://www.bankofamerica.com/promos/jump/ktc_coinjar/index.cfm?&amp;statecheck=NC\\\">Keep the Change program</a>.</p>\\n<p>And, I learned via <a href=\\\"http://www.moneycrashers.com/best-new-bank-account-promotions-offers-free-money/\\\">Money Crashers</a> that Citizens Bank has a <a href=\\\"http://www.citizensbank.com/savings-and-cds/college-saver.aspx\\\">CollegeSaver savings account</a> that gives a one-time $1,000 bonus when your child reaches 18 if you make minimum monthly deposits.</p>\\n<h3>4. Get Cash for Opening and Funding an Investment Account</h3>\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/a-guide-to-online-brokers-for-investing-newbies-and-beyond\\\">Brokerage firms</a> offer incentives for opening and funding an investment account. To get rewards, you typically have to make a hefty deposit. For example, to earn $200, you'll need to put $50,000 in a new account with <a href=\\\"http://content.schwab.com/web/retail/public/cashbonusandtradesira/\\\">Charles Schwab</a> (but you can earn $100 on a deposit of just $10,000 if you are an <a href=\\\"http://content.schwab.com/m/schwab_aarp/\\\">AARP member</a>).</p>\\n<p>However, your bank, credit union, or other financial institution may offer more accessible deals. For example, <a href=\\\"http://www.sharebuilder.com/sharebuilder/special-offers.aspx\\\">ShareBuilder</a> is offering a $50 bonus to open and fund an IRA with $5,000.</p>\\n<h3>5. Snag Your Company's Match</h3>\\n<p>You can make extra money courtesy of your employer if you contribute to a qualified retirement plan and your employer matches contributions. Review plan documents to verify that a match is available. Set aside the percentage of your pay that harvests the maximum payout from your employer.</p>\\n<h3>6. Take Tax Deductions</h3>\\n<p>The federal government and most state governments give you a bonus (in the form or lower taxes) for your contributions to traditional retirement accounts (such as traditional 401ks or IRAs) and Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).</p>\\n<p>There are restrictions for tax deductions, generally based on earnings and the amount of deductible for the <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-types-of-health-insurance-plans\\\">high-deductible health plan</a> linked to the HSA. But if you qualify for tax deductions and put money in these accounts, you can lower your tax liability and increase your cash inflow, either from a larger refund or smaller tax payment.</p>\\n<p>Even though interest rates are low and rewards for saving are often small (even in a <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/the-5-best-high-yield-cds\\\">high-yield CD</a>) or uncertain in investment accounts, there are ways to get cash bonuses that boost your bottom line.</p>\\n<p><em>How have you made money by saving money?</em></p>\\n<a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/6-ways-to-get-paid-for-saving-money\\\" title=\\\"6 Ways to Get Paid for Saving Money \\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">ShareThis</a><br><div><div>Written by <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/julie-rains\\\">Julie Rains</a> and published on <a href=\\\"http://www.wisebread.com/\\\">Wise Bread</a>.

While the article mostly focuses on the social features that were removed from Google Reader a few months after Google+ was launched, there are some thought-provoking insights from former Google Reader engineers that reveal why the service has never been a priority for Google and why it can always be discontinued.<br><br>\\\"In the beginning, the best word I can use is that Google tolerated the project. Then, they gave it — support is too strong a word. They gave it some thought,\\\" said Chris Wetherell, the Googler who started the project. Jenna Bilotta, a former user experience designer at Google, has a slightly different opinion: \\\"Everyone from Google used Reader, from Larry and Sergey to the newest engineers. It's such a beloved project. Still, it was just in this limbo space. It wasn't really supported, but it wasn't actively being harmed.\\\"<br><br><blockquote>The difficulty was that Reader users, while hyperengaged with the product, never snowballed into the tens or hundreds of millions. Brian Shih became the product manager for Reader in the fall of 2008. \\\"If Reader were its own startup, it's the kind of company that Google would have bought. Because we were at Google, when you stack it up against some of these products, it's tiny and isn't worth the investment,\\\" he said. At one point, Shih remembers, engineers were pulled off Reader to work on OpenSocial, a \\\"half-baked\\\" development platform that never amounted to much. \\\"There was always a political fight internally on keeping people staffed on this little project,\\\" he recalled. Someone hung a sign in the Reader offices that said \\\"DAYS SINCE LAST THREAT OF CANCELLATION.\\\" The number was almost always zero. At the same time, user growth — while small next to Gmail's hundreds of millions — more than doubled under Shih's tenure. But the \\\"senior types,\\\" as Bilotta remembers, \\\"would look at absolute user numbers. They wouldn't look at market saturation. So Reader was constantly on the chopping block.\\\"</blockquote><br>iGoogle, a much more popular service, will be discontinued next year and Google Reader's infrastructure is used to show feeds in iGoogle. Hopefully, Google Reader will still be available for some time, but it's mostly wishful thinking.<div>\\n<a href=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?a=fyQD0_fKWn0:20nS1iXMrTo:4cEx4HpKnUU\\\"><img src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?i=fyQD0_fKWn0:20nS1iXMrTo:4cEx4HpKnUU\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"></a> <a href=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?a=fyQD0_fKWn0:20nS1iXMrTo:yIl2AUoC8zA\\\"><img src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"></a> <a href=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?a=fyQD0_fKWn0:20nS1iXMrTo:qj6IDK7rITs\\\"><img src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GoogleOperatingSystem?d=qj6IDK7rITs\\\" border=\\\"0\\\"></a>\\n</div><img src=\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GoogleOperatingSystem/~4/fyQD0_fKWn0\\\" height=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"1\\\">\"\n    },\n    \"author\" : \"Alex Chitu\",\n    \"comments\" : [ ],\n    \"annotations\" : [ ],\n    \"origin\" : {\n      \"streamId\" : \"feed/http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOperatingSystem\",\n      \"title\" : \"Google Operating System\",\n      \"htmlUrl\" : \"http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/\"\n    }\n  } ]\n}"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":27892}]],"length":27892}
